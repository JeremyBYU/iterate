Iterate
=======

This website demonstrates the use of basic numerical analysis of dertermining roots (zero) of real continuous functions. Its 
principles are based on Mathematics and provide a good estimate to the true root of the system.  Each iteration of these numerical methods
should bring you one step closer to true solution. Simply type in a function, your initial guess, range of the solution, and how many iterations you want to compute.
